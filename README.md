# OOPS in C++

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p>- Constructor can never return any value.</p>
<p>- It is only defined within public section in class.</p>
<p>- whatever written inside the constructor will execute automatically when we define object.</p>
<p>- Three type of constructor : -Default -parameterized -copy .</p>
<p>- Three type of Inheritance : -Single -Multilevel -Herarical -Multiple -Hybrid.</p>
<p>- In multiple Inheritance there are only one child class but two or more parents class.</p>   
<p>- When two or more types of Inheritance are combine called as Hybrid Inheritance.</p> 
<p>- <b> Access specifiers </b> are used to determine whether any other class or function, such as the main function can access the attributes and methods of a particular class.</p>
<p>- <b>Data abstraction</b> refers to hiding the implementation details.</p>
<p>- <b>Encapsulation</b> refers to wrapping up of data and functionalities into a single unit.</p>
